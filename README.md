# CreativeTech3
Here is the FIRST assignment for Creative Technology 3;
I am a beginner of Arduino development and Processing development;
I learnt the very basic tutorial online, review some open sources project and finally create my own small project;

This project uses proximity sensor to detect the distance, and the transfer the value to Processing;
Processing receives the value and utilize it to control the Particle system;
I set the value as the limit of the numbers of balls;
When the distance changes, the balls will increase or decrease;
